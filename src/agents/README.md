# Agent System - Example Implementation

## ⚠️ Status: Example/Demo Code

This directory contains **example and demonstration code** for an agent-based code analysis system. These modules are provided as reference implementations and are not part of the production codebase.

## Purpose

The agent system demonstrates:
- How to build modular code analysis tools
- Agent-based architecture patterns
- Coordination between multiple analysis agents
- Report generation from analysis results

## Structure

```
agents/
├── base/               # Core agent interfaces and base classes
├── analysis/           # Analysis agent implementations
├── testing/            # Test generation agents
├── reporting/          # Report generation utilities
├── examples/           # Usage examples and demos
└── demo.ts            # Interactive demonstration script
```

## Usage

These modules are intended for:
- Learning about agent-based architectures
- Understanding code analysis patterns
- Reference for building similar systems
- Testing and experimentation

## Production Readiness

**These modules are NOT production-ready** and contain:
- Type inconsistencies that may trigger TypeScript errors
- Simplified implementations for demonstration purposes
- Mock data and example scenarios
- Incomplete error handling

## Running Examples

```bash
# Run the demo script
npx tsx src/agents/demo.ts

# Run specific examples
npx tsx src/agents/examples/basic-usage.ts
```

## TypeScript Compatibility

Due to the experimental nature of this code, some TypeScript errors are expected and acceptable. The main production build (`npm run build:prod`) excludes these modules.

## Contributing

If you'd like to improve these examples:
1. Maintain their educational value
2. Keep implementations simple and understandable
3. Document any complex patterns
4. Add more examples rather than making existing ones more complex
