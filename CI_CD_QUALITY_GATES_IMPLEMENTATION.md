  "lint": "eslint src --ext .ts",
  "lint:fix": "eslint src --ext .ts --fix", 
  "coverage:check": "vitest run --coverage && npx nyc check-coverage --lines 80 --functions 80 --branches 80 --statements 80",

}
```

## 🚦 Quality Gates Implemented

### 1. Coverage Enforcement (80% threshold)
- **Lines**: ≥ 80%
- **Functions**: ≥ 80% 
- **Branches**: ≥ 80%
- **Statements**: ≥ 80%

**How it works**: 
- Vitest enforces thresholds during test runs
- NYC provides backup coverage checking
- CI fails if coverage drops below 80%
- PR comments show coverage changes

### 2. Code Quality Gates
- **TypeScript**: Must compile without errors
- **ESLint**: Must pass linting rules
- **Complexity**: Functions should stay under complexity 10
- **Dependencies**: No unused dependencies allowed
- **Licenses**: All production dependencies must have acceptable licenses

### 3. Security Gates  
- **npm audit**: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- **Secret scanning**: No secrets in code (if configured)
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Clean audit reports

### 4. Build Verification
- **Compilation**: TypeScript must compile successfully
- **Bundle**: Build artifacts must be generated
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies must install cleanly

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow Changes

### Current Workflow Issues
```yaml
# ❌ OLD (soft failures)
- run: npm test || echo "::warning::Some tests failed"
- run: npm run lint || echo "::warning::Linting failed"
```

### New Workflow (Hard Failures)
```yaml
# ✅ NEW (enforced failures)  
- run: npm run ci:test  # Fails on low coverage
- run: npm run lint     # Fails on lint errors
- run: npm run coverage:check  # Fails on < 80% coverage
```

### Required Status Checks
- `test (18.x)` - Node.js 18 tests
- `test (20.x)` - Node.js 20 tests  
- `quality-check` - Code quality gates
- `security-check` - Security scanning
- `build` - Build verification

## 📊 Coverage Reporting

### PR Coverage Comments
- **Coverage percentage** and change
- **Files with low coverage** highlighted
- **Uncovered lines** identified
- **Coverage trends** over time

### Multiple Report Formats
- **Text**: Console output
- **HTML**: Interactive reports (`coverage/html/`)
- **LCOV**: For Codecov integration
- **Cobertura**: For PR comments
- **JSON**: For programmatic access

## 🛠 Implementation Steps

### 1. Install New Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Replace CI Workflow
**⚠️ Important**: Replace `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with the content from `ci-workflow-template.yml`

### 3. Configure Branch Protection  
Follow the guide in `BRANCH_PROTECTION_SETUP.md` to:
- Add branch protection rule for `main` branch
- Require all status checks to pass
- Enable coverage enforcement

### 4. Set Up Coverage Service (Optional)
- **Codecov**: For advanced coverage analytics
- **PR Comments**: Automatic via GitHub Actions
- **Badges**: Add to README for visibility

### 5. Test the Setup
```bash
# Run quality checks locally
npm run quality:check

# Test coverage enforcement  
npm run coverage:check

# Check for issues
npm run quality:dependencies
npm run security:scan
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] All new scripts run without errors
- [ ] Coverage thresholds enforced (fails on < 80%)
- [ ] Linting rules applied and passing
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] Security audit passes
- [ ] CI workflow updated with hard failures
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured
- [ ] PR coverage comments working
- [ ] Quality gates preventing bad merges

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### Before Implementation
- ❌ Code with < 80% coverage could be merged
- ❌ Linting failures were only warnings  
- ❌ No visibility into coverage changes
- ❌ Quality issues accumulated over time

### After Implementation
- ✅ PRs must have ≥ 80% coverage to merge
- ✅ All quality gates must pass before merge
- ✅ Coverage changes visible in PR comments
- ✅ Comprehensive quality monitoring
- ✅ Technical debt prevention
- ✅ Security vulnerability blocking

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Monitor coverage trends** in PR comments
- **Review complexity reports** for refactoring opportunities
- **Update dependencies** to address security issues
- **Adjust thresholds** as codebase matures

### When Quality Gates Fail
1. **Coverage**: Add tests for uncovered code
2. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixes
3. **Complexity**: Refactor complex functions
4. **Dependencies**: Remove unused packages
5. **Security**: Update vulnerable dependencies

## 📞 Support

For issues with the quality gates implementation:
1. Check local setup with `npm run quality:check`
2. Review CI logs for specific failure reasons
3. Reference documentation in created `.md` files
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

**Priority**: High - Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation
